# Project manifest

Here is a cite from [Kohsuke Kawaguchi](https://github.com/kohsuke/), who is the original author of this project:

> Now, I think the first question that people would ask is, why another, when there's [Java Service Wrapper project](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/download.jsp) already available.
> The main reason for writing my own was the license â€” Java Service Wrapper project is in GPL (so that they can sell their commercial version in a different license), and that made it difficult for [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) (which is under the MIT license) to use it.

> Functionality-wise, there's really not much that's worth noting; the problem of wrapping a process as a Windows service is so well defined that there aren't really any room for substantial innovation.
> You basically write a configuration file specifying how you'd like your process to be launched, and we provide programmatic means to install/uninstall/start/stop services.
> Another notable difference is that winsw can host any executable, whereas Java Service Wrapper can only host Java apps.
> Whether you like this or not depends on your taste, so I wouldn't claim mine is better.
> It's just different.
>
> As the name implies, this is for Windows only.
> Unix systems have their own conventions for daemons, so a good behaving Unix daemon should just be using `launchd/upstart/SMF/etc`, instead of custom service wrapper.
