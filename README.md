WinSW is an executable binary, which can be used to wrap and manage a custom process as a Windows service.
Once you download the installation package, you can rename *WinSW.exe* to any name, e.g. *MyService.exe*.

**We are actively developing WinSW v3. Please refer to the v2 branch for previous version documentation.**

**Please help us prioritize items by voting or commenting on the issues!**

## Why?

See the [project manifest](MANIFEST.md).

## Supported platforms

WinSW 3 can run on Windows platforms with .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later versions installed.
For systems without .NET Framework, the project provides native 64-bit and 32-bit executables based on .NET Core.

More executables can be added upon request.

## Download

WinSW binaries are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/winsw/winsw/releases) and [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WinSW/).

Alternative sources:

* [Maven packaging](https://github.com/jenkinsci/winsw-maven-packaging) for executables, hosted by the [Jenkins project](https://jenkins.io/). 
Binaries are available [here](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/com/sun/winsw/winsw/).

## Usage

WinSW is being managed by the [XML configuration file](docs/xml-config-file.md).

Your renamed *WinSW.exe* binary also accepts the following commands:

| Command                                               | Description |
| -----------                                           | ----------- |
| [install](docs/cli-commands.md#install-command)     | Installs the service. This command requires some preliminary steps described in the [installation guide](docs/installation.md). |
| [uninstall](docs/cli-commands.md#uninstall-command) | Uninstalls the service. |
| [start](docs/cli-commands.md#start-command)         | Starts the service. |
| [stop](docs/cli-commands.md#stop-command)           | Stops the service. |
| [restart](docs/cli-commands.md#restart-command)     | Stops and then starts the service. |
| [status](docs/cli-commands.md#status-command)       | Checks the status of the service. |
| [test](docs/cli-commands.md#test-command)           | Checks if the service can be started and then stopped without installation. |
| [refresh](docs/cli-commands.md#refresh-command)     | Refreshes the service properties without reinstallation. |

Most commands require Administrator privileges to execute. Since 2.8, WinSW will prompt for UAC in non-elevated sessions.
