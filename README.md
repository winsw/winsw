WinSW wraps and manages any application as a Windows service.

**We are actively developing WinSW 3. Please refer to the [v2](https://github.com/winsw/winsw/tree/master) branch for previous version documentation.**

**Please help us prioritize items by voting or commenting on the issues!**

## Why?

See the [project manifest](MANIFEST.md).

## Supported platforms

WinSW 3 can run on Windows platforms with .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later versions installed.
For systems without .NET Framework, the project provides native 64-bit and 32-bit executables based on .NET Core.

More executables can be added upon request.

## Usage

WinSW is being managed by the [XML configuration file](docs/xml-config-file.md).

Your renamed *WinSW.exe* binary also accepts the following commands:

| Command                                             | Description |
| -------                                             | ----------- |
| [install](docs/cli-commands.md#install-command)     | Installs the service. This command requires some preliminary steps described in the [installation guide](docs/installation.md). |
| [uninstall](docs/cli-commands.md#uninstall-command) | Uninstalls the service. |
| [start](docs/cli-commands.md#start-command)         | Starts the service. |
| [stop](docs/cli-commands.md#stop-command)           | Stops the service. |
| [restart](docs/cli-commands.md#restart-command)     | Stops and then starts the service. |
| [status](docs/cli-commands.md#status-command)       | Checks the status of the service. |
| [test](docs/cli-commands.md#test-command)           | Checks if the service can be started and then stopped without installation. |
| [refresh](docs/cli-commands.md#refresh-command)     | Refreshes the service properties without reinstallation. |
| [customize](docs/cli-commands.md#customize-command) | Customizes the wrapper executable. |
| dev                                                 | Experimental commands. |

Experimental commands:

| Command                                           | Description |
| -------                                           | ----------- |
| [dev ps](docs/cli-commands.md#dev-ps-command)     | Draws the process tree associated with the service. |
| [dev kill](docs/cli-commands.md#dev-kill-command) | Terminates the service if it has stopped responding. |
| [dev list](docs/cli-commands.md#dev-list-command) | Lists services managed by the current executable. |

Most commands require Administrator privileges to execute. WinSW will prompt for UAC in non-elevated sessions.
