# WinSW EXE Configuration File

In addition to the [XML Configuration File](xmlConfigFile.md), WinSW uses a standard .NET *WinSW.exe.config* file, which allows setting up some custom settings.

Use-cases:
* Declaring compatibility with newer .NET versions (see the [Installation Guide](installation.md))
* Managing custom behavior for the offline mode (see the [Installation Guide](installation.md))
* Managing Logging levels of log4j
* etc.
