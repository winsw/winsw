            Make sure to update the commits so that the merge results in helpful release notes, see [Merging the Pull Request & releasing a new version](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#merging-the-pull-request--releasing-a-new-version).

            In general

            - Avoid breaking changes at all costs
            - If there are no typescript changes, use `build: cache` as commit message
            - If there are there are only updates, use `fix: ...`
            - If there are any new additions, use `feat: ...`
            - If there are breaking changes, keep the previous ones and deprecate them. Only if there is no other way, add `BREAKING CHANGE: ...` to the commit body (not subject!) to trigger a breaking change.
